# Development Workflow (without Expo Go)

## Why not Expo Go?

This project uses **SDK 55**. Expo Go on the Play Store only supported SDK 54 at the time of development — it did not update in time for Android 16 devices. Additionally, `react-native-keyboard-controller` is a native library that requires a custom build and cannot run inside Expo Go regardless of SDK version.

For these reasons the project uses a **development client** — a custom APK built via EAS that includes the exact SDK and native libraries this project needs.

## First-time setup (only needed once, or when adding new native packages)

**1. Build the dev client APK:**
```bash
npm run build:dev
```
When the build finishes, install the APK on your Android device from the EAS build page at expo.dev.

**2. Start the dev server:**
```bash
npm run dev-client
```

**3. Open the dev client app on your phone** — it looks similar to Expo Go but is your own custom build. On its home screen there is a QR scanner.

**4. Scan the QR code** shown in your terminal. Your app loads with full hot reload.

## Daily development

Just run `npm run dev-client`, open the dev client app on your phone and scan the QR code. No rebuild needed unless you add a new native package.

## Build times

EAS builds typically take **10–20 minutes** for Android. The first build is slower as EAS sets up the environment fresh — subsequent builds are faster due to caching.

# Keyboard Handling

This project uses `react-native-keyboard-controller` to keep inputs visible above the keyboard. This library requires the dev client — it does **not** work with Expo Go.

## Setup

Already installed. `KeyboardProvider` wraps the entire app in `src/app/_layout.tsx` — this is required for all keyboard controller APIs to work.

## Pattern: screens with regular inputs

Use `KeyboardAwareScrollView` — it automatically scrolls to the focused input:

```tsx
import { KeyboardAwareScrollView, KeyboardToolbar } from 'react-native-keyboard-controller';

<>
    <KeyboardAwareScrollView
        style={{ flex: 1 }}
        keyboardShouldPersistTaps="handled"
        bottomOffset={80}
        contentContainerStyle={{ paddingBottom: 400 }}
    >
        <TextInput ... />
        <TextInput ... />
    </KeyboardAwareScrollView>
    <KeyboardToolbar />
</>
```

Key notes:
- `bottomOffset` — extra space between the keyboard and the focused input (increase to show more context)
- `paddingBottom: 400` on `contentContainerStyle` — ensures the scroll view can always scroll even with few items
- `KeyboardToolbar` — shows a Done/Prev/Next toolbar above the keyboard. Conditionally render it if you only want it for specific inputs (e.g. `{editingWord ? <KeyboardToolbar /> : null}`)

## Pattern: excluding inputs from KeyboardToolbar navigation

If a screen has inputs that should not be reachable via the toolbar arrows (e.g. an "Add word" field separate from edit fields), unmount them while other inputs are active:

```tsx
{!editingWord && (
    <View>
        <TextInput placeholder="Add a word..." />
    </View>
)}
```

## Pattern: autoFocus with KeyboardToolbar

Do not use `autoFocus` on the first input of an edit form — the toolbar won't show arrows because the second input hasn't registered yet. Instead, use a ref and focus after a short delay so all inputs are mounted first:

```tsx
const sentenceRef = useRef<TextInput>(null);

useEffect(() => {
    if (editingWord) {
        setTimeout(() => sentenceRef.current?.focus(), 50);
    }
}, [editingWord]);

<TextInput ref={sentenceRef} ... />
```
